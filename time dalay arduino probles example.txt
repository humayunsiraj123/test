the typical loop you are looking for is BlinkWithoutDelay.

there is a system time millis() that counts in microseconds.

you can note that time

then = millis() ;
duration = millis() - then ;

but, that would just refresh each loop. and you want to create a delay anyway.

lets use a value.

int period = 1000 ; put before setup.
int then, duration ;

in loop() put this

duration = millis() - then ;

if (duration >= period )
{
// do that thing you want to do ;
then = millis(); // starts the timer all over again
}

just change the period to whatever you need.
as a note, this is only for very short timing periods.
for longer periods, you would want to use unsigned long and not int

blink without delay has many-many variations. this is just a simple one.

duration = millis() - then ;
if (duration >= period ) {
// do that thing you want to do
then = millis(); // starts the timer all over again
count++ ; // increments a counter each period
}

if (count >= 60) {
// read temperature
count = 0 ;
}

this sequence does a thing each second ( whatever your period is)
then increments count
and after 60 seconds, it would read the temperature.

same stuff to increment count.... and add count_HR before setup

if (count >= 60) {
// read soil moisture
count = 0 ; // reset
count_HR++ ;
}

if ( count_HR == 24) {
// send daily temperature to web data logger
count_HR = 0 ; // reset
}
